This section shows how SvAnna prioritizes various structural variant classes.
The resulting HTML reports contain graphics that are reported in the supplement of SvAnna paper.

The examples work with variants stored in `examples.vcf`_ file. The VCF file is stored in SvAnna GitHub repository.
Use the `run_examples.sh`_ script to generate HTML reports for all cases described below. Note that you must enter
the paths to SvAnna JAR file, data directory, and the ``examples.vcf`` into the script before running.
